## a command line openai chatbot.

### Run it in a terminal: 

first, in a .env file, set `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

then run: `npm i && node index.js`

### commands

`clear`: clears chat history

`exit`: quits the process but you can always use `<C-c>`

This is especially nice if you use tmux and want a single panel dedicated to the chatbot.
At least thats why I made it.
